# Audit Logs

RoWifi generates logs for all commands ran and it can send them in a Discord Text Channel upon configuration.

## Creating a Logs Channel

There are two ways to create a log channel:

### 1. Using the inbuilt way

To use the inbuilt way of creating a log channel, simply create a channel called `#rowifi-logs`.

### 2. Setting via a command

To set a log channel, run the command `/settings log-channel`.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-400 to-pink-500 flex py-2 md:py-4 xl:py-8 px-1 md:px-4 xl:px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={settings_log_channel}
    alt="Settings Log Channel"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>

It has one required argument.

- **channel**: The Discord Text Channel you want to set as the log channel
