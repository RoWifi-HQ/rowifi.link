# Verification

## Linking your account for the first time

To link your Roblox account to your Discord account, run the following command. The bot will then reply with a button
linking to a game place. Join the game and the Verification process is now complete. After this you can run the `/update` command.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500 flex py-8 px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={verifySetup}
    alt="Verification"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>

## Adding another linked account

To link an additional Roblox account to your Discord account, run the `/verify add` command. The bot will then reply with a button
linking to a game place. Join the game and you have successfully linked an additional Roblox account. You should look at the
following section to learn about switching between accounts.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500 flex py-8 px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={verifyAdd}
    alt="Verify Add"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>

## Setting a default account

To set an additional linked account as your default account, run the `/verify default` command.

**NOTE**: This will set the given account as your default account in all new servers and in any servers where you have not
run `/verify switch` explicitly.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500 flex py-8 px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={verifyDefault}
    alt="Verify Add"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>

## Switching accounts between servers

To use an additional linked account in a server, run the `/verify switch` command and now, you have successfully switched your
account for that server. You can now run `/update` to get your roles.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500 flex py-8 px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={verifySwitch}
    alt="Verify Add"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>

## Unlinking an account

To unlink an account, run the command `/verify delete`. You will now have successfully unlinked your Roblox account.

<div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-400 to-blue-500 flex py-8 px-6 rounded-sm">
  <Image
    src={verifyDelete}
    alt="Verify Add"
    className="rounded-md shadow-xl"
    placeholder="blur"
  />
</div>
