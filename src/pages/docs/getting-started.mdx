# Quick Start

This guide will show you everything needed to get started with RoWifi in an opinionated way.

## 1. Add the bot to the server

<Copyable>
  https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=508968886998269962&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=402738240
</Copyable>
First step is to add the bot to your server. Open the link above in a new tab, select
your server and click `Authorize`. The bot should now be visible in your discord
server.

## 2. Setup the unverified and verified roles

Create two roles named `@Unverified` and `@Verified` respectively. Now to set the unverified role,
run the command `!settings verification @Unverified`. Similarly, to set the verified role, run the command
`!settings verified @Verified`.

  {({ open }) => (
    <div className="border-t border-b py-2 border-[#333]">
      <Disclosure.Button className="flex items-center w-full">
        <span className="font-semibold">
          Q. What are the unverified and verified roles?
        </span>
        <ChevronDownIcon
          className={`${open ? "transform rotate-180" : ""} w-7 h-7 ml-auto`}
        />
      </Disclosure.Button>
      <Transition
        enter="transition duration-200 ease-out"
        enterFrom="transform opacity-0 -translate-y-6"
        enterTo="transform opacity-100 translate-y-0"
        leave="transition duration-200 ease-out"
        leaveFrom="transform opacity-100 translate-y-0"
        leaveTo="transform opacity-0 -translate-y-6"
      >
        <Disclosure.Panel as="p" className="mt-5">
          <code>Unverified</code> role is a Discord Role that is given to users
          who do <b>NOT</b> have a linked account with RoWifi. Similarly,{" "}
          <code>Verified</code> role is a discord role that is given to users
          who have a linked account with RoWifi.
        </Disclosure.Panel>
      </Transition>
    </div>

## 3. Creating a Groupbind

Now that we've gone through the basic setup, let's create the first bind which will be a [groupbind](/docs/groupbinds). This type
of bind gives a role to any user present in the group. Let's create one more role, `@Member`. Next, run the slash command
`/groupbinds new`. Enter the Group Id of your main Roblox group, the template as `N/A`, and add `@Member` in the discord roles argument.

## 4. Creating a Rankbind

Now that everyone in the group will get a name, let's give a role & a nickname to the first rank of the group.

> For the sake of simplicity, let's assume the first rank has an ID of 5 and a name of **Newbie**.

Our goal of this rankbind is to make the user have a nickname of `[Newbie] RobloxUsername` and add a role `@Newbie`. To proceed further,
create the `@Newbie` role.

To make a rankbind, run the command `rankbinds new`. Enter the Group ID of your main Roblox group, the Rank Id as `5`,
the template as `[Newbie] {roblox-username}`. Set the [priority](/docs/priority) to 1 and add the `@Newbie` role to the
discord roles argument.

        leave="transition duration-200 ease-out"
        leaveFrom="transform opacity-100 translate-y-0"

        <Disclosure.Panel className="mt-5">
          It is a number that informs the bot which bind to use for the nickname
          of a user. The bot will always choose the bind with the highest
          priority.
