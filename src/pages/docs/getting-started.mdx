# Quick Start

This guide will show you everything needed to get started with RoWifi.

## 1. Add the bot to the server

First step is to add the bot to your server. Open the link above in a new tab, select
your server and click `Authorize`. The bot should now be visible in your discord
server.

## 2. Setup the unverified and verified roles

Create two roles named `@Unverified` and `@Verified` respectively.
