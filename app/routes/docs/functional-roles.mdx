# Functional Roles

Functional Roles are a feature of RoWifi that allow you to grant certain RoWifi permissions to a subset of users.
There are four types of Functional Roles: `RoWifi Admin`, `RoWifi Bypass`, `RoWifi Nickname Bypass`, `RoWifi Trainer`.

## RoWifi Admin

This functional role grants the permission to use any RoWifi command to an user. This can be done without granting the user
the `Administrator` permission on Discord. However, by default, any user with the `Administrator` permission can use all
RoWifi commands.

There are two ways for creating this functional role:

### 1. Using the inbuilt role

To enable the admin functionality, simply create a Discord role called `RoWifi Admin` and that's it.

#### Adding a Custom Admin Role

To add any Discord role as a `RoWifi Admin` role, run the command `settings admin` and select the `option` argument as `Add`.

#### Removing a Custom Admin Role

To remove an existing Discord role as a `RoWifi Admin` role, run the command `settings admin` and select the `option` argument as `Remove`.

#### Setting a list of Admin Roles

To overwrite all existing `RoWifi Admin` roles, run the command `settings admin` and select the `option` argument as `Set`.

#### Viewing a list of Admin Roles

## RoWifi Bypass

This functional role allows them to bypass the `update` command run on them. It also allows them to bypass being updated in
Auto Detection.

There are two ways for creating this functional role:

### 1. Using the inbuilt role

To enable the bypass functionality, simply create a Discord role called `RoWifi Bypass` and that's it.

functionality also applies during Auto Detection.

There are two ways for creating this functional role:

### 1. Using the inbuilt role

#### Viewing a list of Nickname Bypass Roles
