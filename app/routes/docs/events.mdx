Events is a premium module that lets track any events that members of your server may host and log.

## Logging an event

To log an event, run the command `event new`. The bot will then prompt you to select an event type from the existing ones.
Next, the bot will ask you to enter the Roblox usernames of the users who attended this event. After this, the event has been
successfully logged.
